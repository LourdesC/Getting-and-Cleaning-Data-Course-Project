# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository contains teh followings files:
1. run_analysis.R , that does the following. 

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for            each activity and each subject.

2. CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

3.  tidydata.txt, that is a tidy data set as described in past 5 of run_analysis.R
